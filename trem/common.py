"""Common functions to prepare TPM and to handle/plot/utilize the results.

- About location
location is like '(MPCcode)' (e.g., 381), 
                 '(MPCcode)@(399, which means Earth)' (e.g., 381@391)
The latter part is to specify major body 
    (Earth '391', Sun '10', Moon '301', solar system barycenter '0' or 'ssb' etc.)
The former part is to specify point on the major body (body center 500 etc.)

J.B. notes that we have to set '@10', or 'None' (not '@0' or 'ssb')
since  the center of Ecliptic coordinate system, 
which is used in Marco's TPM code, is the Sun (not solar system barycenter).


location refers to the coordinate center for the ephemeris, which has 
slightly different physical interpretations depending on the query type: 
  - observer (ephemerides) queries
  - observer location vectors queries
  - (coordinate origin for vectors elements queries)
  - (relative body for orbital elements)

The default value is None for all queries, which corresponds to
  - Earth body center for observer (ephemerides) queries 
    (i.e., location=500, 500@391)
  - Sun body center for orbital elements and vectors queries 
    (i.e., location=@10, 500@10)


2024-05-15 J.B. confirmed that the generated ephem file with @10 
           matched that in DAFEED better than that with @0. 
           J.B. confirmed that the generated obs file with light time correction
           matched that in DAFEED with an accuracy of 0.01 s.
